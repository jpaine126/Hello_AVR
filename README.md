# Hello_AVR

https://github.com/jpaine126/Hello_AVR

Minimum project to test toolchain and uploading for AVR. All it does it pulse pin PB5 (included LED on the Arduino Uno).

Also included is a basic makefile to build and upload to an arduino board. Currently it only works with single file projects, but it will be extended in the future.
